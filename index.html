  <div class="Zimbabwe">
  	<p>Zimbabwe<br />
<small> Zimbabwe is situated in the southern part of Africa, between South Africa and Zambia. Fellowship is a big part of Christmas Day in Zimbabwe. Since the country is located south of the equator, Kisimusi, or Christmas is celebrated December 25, during the broiling hot summer. Starting weeks in advance, everyone starts to gather loaves of bread, jam, tea, and sugar for the Christmas dinner. On Christmas Eve, a fir tree is placed in the main room and decorated with colorful ornaments, mostly hand crafted. Gifts are then placed under the tree and a member of the family, one of the elders, is selected to be the “Santa” for the gift distribution on Christmas Day. Fathers give gifts to their children and wives, usually consisting of clothes and candy.</small> </p>

   <div class="Ghana">
  	<p>Ghana<br />
<small> Christmas in Ghana is a well-deserved break, coinciding with the end of the cocoa harvest and beginning on December 1, four weeks before Christmas. Families decorate their homes and neighborhoods like we do here in the US, using lights, candles and sparkly ornaments. For most Ghanaians, it’s just the beginning. On Christmas Day, things really kick into full swing, starting with a family meal –- usually consisting of goat, vegetables and soup –- and followed by a church service for the whole community and a colorful holiday parade.</small> </p>
</div>

  <div class="South Africa">
  	<p>South Africa<br />
<small> One major difference is that in South Africa Christmas is celebrated in the middle of summer. Flowers are blooming, the sun is shining and everything is alive. All that vitality is brought to life even more by the festive mood of the people. The decorations, markets, carolers and Christmas dinner (which in South Africa is more of an outdoor lunch) help you get into the Christmas spirit. South Africa is a country with a great affinity for outdoor activities, so it's no surprise that thousands of people celebrate the holiday season with visits to Kruger National Park. Church services are held on Christmas morning. Christmas Eve celebrations in larger centers include "Carols by Candlelight" and special screen and floor shows.</small> </p>
